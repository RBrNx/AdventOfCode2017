  "aboutProject": "<p>Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for a beginner who is just learning to code, as they are for an expert who wants to stay sharp.</p><p>Each day throughout December a new puzzle is released, each one with two parts to solve and two gold stars to collect. Every year there is a different story that explains why you need to collect these gold stars, usually it's to help Santa!</p><p>I have individual Github repositories containing my answers for each year that Advent of Code has been running.</p>",
